For this project, I performed analytics on different data sets that looked at music sales information. The tables looked at the customers, employees, invoices, music artist, album,
genre, media type, playlists, and tracks.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT CustomerId,
FirstName,
LastName,
Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS i 
ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name as Track, art.Name as Artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items AS i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks AS t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums AS a
 ON a.Albumid = t.Albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists AS art 
ON art.ArtistId = a.AlbumId

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name as 'Track Name', a.Title as 'Album Title', m.Name as 'Media Type', g.Name as 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t 
JOIN chinook.albums a 
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId 
JOIN chinook.media_types m 
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#13. SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) as "Total Sales"
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust 
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC LIMIT 1;
